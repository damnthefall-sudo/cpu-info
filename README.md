CPU Info [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kamgurgul/cpu-info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kamgurgul/cpu-info)<br/>
========
CPU Info provides information about Android device hardware and software.
Most of the code is written in Kotlin but some old widgets are still in
Java.

Due to lack of time, this project will be updated sporadically. Right now it is only a sandbox.
